//! Neighbor selection during HNSW construction.
//!
//! Two variants:
//!
//! - `select_neighbors_simple` (Algorithm 3 in Malkov-Yashunin 2018):
//!   sort candidates ascending by distance to the inserted node, keep
//!   top-m. Cheap. Picks geometrically-closest neighbors but tends to
//!   create dense clusters that hurt recall on non-uniform corpora.
//!
//! - `select_neighbors_heuristic` (Algorithm 4): iteratively pick the
//!   closest remaining candidate, but reject it if there is already a
//!   chosen neighbor that is closer to the candidate than the candidate
//!   is to the query — meaning the candidate is "shadowed" by an
//!   already-chosen point. This gives angular diversity. Refills any
//!   shortfall from the pruned set so neighbor lists actually reach m.
//!
//! Build (`super::build`) calls the heuristic. Simple is kept for unit
//! tests and as the lower-bound reference baseline.
